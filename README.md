I started my professional life volunteering inside a local non-profit which had been exploited by external IT providers, fleeced by so-called experts, and left in the lurch of service level agreements. Witness to these horrors organisations were put through, it became my personal mission to provide first-class, honest and ethical solutions to information problems. Over the last decade, i have moved from volunteering 3500 hours of my personal time within a non-profit to supporting and developing dozens of organisations across the UK in a range of sectors from Charitable to Public sector.

After around 15 years in the MSP space I transitioned over to a vendor who aligned with my ethcial standards, joining their community team with direct input to product. A year later moving into the Product team for RMM.

On a personal level, I have been interested in computing the majority of my life, working over a wide range of operating systems and using countless technologies, always adopting the latest and greatest with enthusiasm.
